/*!
 * Function to determine LSF coefficients for a given 
 * speech buffer (xin) of length amountSpeechSamples.
 * For the windowing purpose the speech buffer can be weighted 
 * window specified as function pointer f_windowSpeech which
 * must not be symmetric (lower bound: 0, upper bound: amountSpeechSamples-1,
 * modified middle: middleFromLeft).
 * The function must be able to return for one index, the upper boundary
 * and the modified middle position a windowing weight (return value double).
 * The result of the autocorrelation function can also be weighted by a window
 * specified as function pointer f_windowCorr. The mechanism is the same as the
 * one for speech windowing.
 * This function is not very efficient due to the fact that the window must be evaluated 
 * for each function call. For testing purpose different weighting functions can 
 * be tested. 
 * Return value is 1 for stable filter, 0 for instable one.*/
